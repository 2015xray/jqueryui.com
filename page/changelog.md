## [1.9.0 Changelog](/changelog/1.9.0/)
Released in the FUTURE!

<hr class="dots">

Please bear with us while we import older upgrade guides. In the meantime,
you can find the old upgrade guides on the old docs site:
[docs.jquery.com/UI/Changelog](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Changelog).

We're always looking for help, so if you're looking for an easy way to give
back to the community, consider [forking this site](https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com),
adding a chnagelog or two and sending a pull request.
