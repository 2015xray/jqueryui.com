## General

This is a preview release for [jQuery UI 1.8](/changelog/1.8). It is the first beta release of the 1.8 series, not final or production-ready. This release adds

* jQuery 1.4
* a new widget factory that is not backward compatible with the old widget factory
* two new plugins: button and autocomplete

In addition, the stackfix plugin was removed in favor of reverting back
to the bgiframe plugin.
