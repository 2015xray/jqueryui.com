Please bear with us while we import older upgrade guides. In the meantime,
you can find the old upgrade guides on the old docs site:
[1.8.5](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Upgrade_Guide/1.8.5),
[1.8.4](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Upgrade_Guide_184),
[1.8](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Upgrade_Guide_18),
[1.7](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Upgrade_Guide_17).

We're always looking for help, so if you're looking for an easy way to give
back to the community, consider [forking this site](https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com),
adding an upgrade guide or two and sending a pull request.
